Consider the following schema 
STUDENT (Name, StudentNumber, Class, Major)
COURSE  (CourseName , CourseNumber,  CreditHours , Dept)
SECTION  (SectionIdentifier ,CourseNumber , Semester, Year ,Instructor)
Grade_Report  (StudentNumber ,SectionIdentifier ,Grade)
Prerequisite (CourseNumber, PrerequisiteNumber)

Set - 01
a)Retrieve the names of all the courses taught by the Professors during the period 2001- 2004

b) We need to maintain a report of students as follows:

Student_Report(StudentNumber, SectionIdentifier,marks)

Populate the report with each student's number, the courses(sectons) he/she has registered/enrolled for, with marks of each student for the courses they have enrolled. 
(Marks should be in multiples of 10 with maximum of 100 marks). 
****You cannot use insert statement directly for the above question to populate existing data, Only for new data to be inserted you can use insert statement directly****

c)Create a trigger so that the total marks scored by each student is automatically updated in the result sheet whenever a record is inserted into Student_Report.
students_result(StudentNumber,Totalmarks)

d) Create a trigger to specify the remarks based on the Major of a student as follows:

Major 'CS' ---> "Computer Science Engg"
Major 'EC'   ---> "Electronics Engg


Set - 02

a) Retrieve the names and major departments of all students who do not have a grade "A" in any of their courses.

b) We need to maintain report of the student as follows:
Student_Report(StudentNumber, SectionIdentifier,marks, Instructor)

Populate the report with each student's number, the courses(sectons) he/she has registered/enrolled for, with marks of each student for the courses they have enrolled and the Instructor. 
(Marks should be in multiples of 10 with maximum of 100 marks). 
****You cannot use insert statement directly for the above question to populate existing data, Only for new data to be inserted you can use insert statement directly****

c) Create a trigger so that the total and remarks scored by each student is automatically updated in the result sheet whenever a record is inserted into Student_Report.
students_result(StudentNumber,Total,Average)

d) Create a trigger to specify the remarks based on the grade of a student as follows:
Grade A -- "Excellent"
Grade B -- "Very Good"
Grade C -- "Fair"
